Hi guys! My name is Chuong, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/ "Georgia Tech") with a concentration in Systems & Architecture and Info Internetwork.

I'm interested in cyber security topics such as penetration testing, exploit development, reverse engineering, and malware development.

I'm dedicating this blog to writing about my projects as well as the things that I'm learning as I explore the security field!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay! 

:blush:
