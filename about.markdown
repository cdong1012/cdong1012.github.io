I'm Chuong. I'm a former reverse engineer on Mandiant FLARE team. I do a lot of reverse engineering and malware analysis in my freetime! Currently very interested in software obfuscation!
<br/><br/>
This blog is used to keep track of the reverse engineering work I do in my free time. Anything posted here is my own work and is not affiliated with any of my past or future employers.
