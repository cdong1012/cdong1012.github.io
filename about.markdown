<p style="text-align:center;">This is me :blush:</p>

**Hi guys! My name is Chuong, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/ "Georgia Tech") with a concentration in Systems & Architecture and Info Internetwork.**

**I'm interested in cyber security topics such as penetration testing, exploit development, reverse engineering, and malware development.**

**I'm dedicating this blog to writing about my projects as well as the things that I'm learning as I explore the security field!**

**Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay!**
