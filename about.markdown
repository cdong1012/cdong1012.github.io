Hi guys! My name is Chuong, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/ "Georgia Tech") concentrating in Systems & Architecture and Info Internetwork.

I'm an upcoming Reverse Engineering Intern for FireEye's FLARE team in summer 2021!

I do a lot of reverse engineering and malware development for fun, but currently I'm a bit inactive since school is killing me right now.

I'm dedicating this blog to writing about my projects as well as the things that I learn as I explore the security field!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
