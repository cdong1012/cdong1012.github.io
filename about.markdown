# About Me

<br/>
Hi guys! My name is Chuong, and I'm currently a reverse engineer on Mandiant FLARE team.

I do a lot of reverse engineering and malware development in my freetime!

I'm dedicating this blog to writing about my projects as well as the things that I learn as I explore the security field! Anything posted here is my own work and is not affiliated with any company that I work/worked for.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
