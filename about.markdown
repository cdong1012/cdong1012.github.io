Hi guys! My name is Chuong, and I'm a Computer Science student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/ "Georgia Tech") concentrating in Systems & Architecture and Info Internetwork.

I do a lot of reverse engineering and malware development in my freetime!

I'm dedicating this blog to writing about my projects as well as the things that I learn as I explore the security field! Anything posted here is my own work and is not affiliated with any company that I work/worked for.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
